# Gomoku game demonstration

## Description

A console app, which simulates a complete gomoku game between two players. 

Gomoku is a traditional Japanese boardgame played on a 15x15 board with black and white stones. Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Right now, it shows only the end state of the gomoku board when executed.
Moves for both players are made by a computer using not perfect, but good-enough strategy.
