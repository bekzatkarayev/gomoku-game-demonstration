Gomoku game demonstration.

A console app, which simulates a complete gomoku game between two players. 
Right now, it shows only the end state of the gomoku board when executed.
But it can be enabled to show state of the board after each move, after uncommenting a line of code.
Moves for both players are made by a computer using not perfect, but good-enough strategy.
